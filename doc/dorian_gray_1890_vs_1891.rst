Comparing publications 1890 and 1891
====================================


This is what ``diff`` produces when comparing the publications of
:ref:`1890 <sphinxdiff-dorian-gray-1890>` and 
:ref:`1891 <sphinxdiff-dorian-gray-1891>` by a line comparison.

The chapter below is the plain output (used for unit testing).
You see that the material is prepared for review:
it is (close to the) the unified diff view on the changes for easy overview.
On the other hand the material incculdes insignifante chages just because of 
different interpubtation or grammar. 
(We normalized both texts with respect to whitespaces and line width.)

----------------------------------

As he was sitting at breakfast next morning, Basil Hallward was shown
into the room.

"I am so glad I have found you, Dorian," he said, gravely.
"I called last night, and they told me you were at the Opera.
Of course I knew that was impossible.
But I wish you had left word where you had really gone to.
I passed a dreadful evening, half afraid that one tragedy might be
followed by another.
I think you might have telegraphed for me when you heard of it first.

But where were you?
Did you go down and see the girl's mother?
For a moment I thought of following you there.
They gave the address in the paper.
Somewhere in the Euston Road, isn't it?
But I was afraid of intruding upon a sorrow that I could not lighten.
Poor woman!
What a state she must be in!
And her only child, too!
What did she say about it all?"

pale-yellow wine from a delicate gold-beaded bubble of Venetian glass,
and looking dreadfully bored.
"I was at the Opera.
You should have come on there.
I met Lady Gwendolen, Harry's sister, for the first time.
We were in her box.
She is perfectly charming; and Patti sang divinely.
Don't talk about horrid subjects.
If one doesn't talk about a thing, it has never happened.
It is simply expression, as Harry says, that gives reality to things.

.. change::
   - Tell me about yourself and what you are painting."
   + I may mention that she was not the woman's only child.
   + There is a son, a charming fellow, I believe.
   + But he is not on the stage.
   + He is a sailor, or something.
   + And now, tell me about yourself and what you are painting."


"You went to the Opera?" said Hallward, speaking very slowly, and with
a strained touch of pain in his voice.
"You went to the Opera while Sibyl Vane was lying dead in some sordid
lodging?
You can talk to me of other women being charming, and of Patti singing
divinely, before the girl you loved has even the quiet of a grave to
sleep in?
Why, man, there are horrors in store for that little white body of
hers!"

"Stop, Basil! I won't hear it!" cried Dorian, leaping to his feet.
"You must not tell me about things.
What is done is done.
What is past is past."

"You call yesterday the past?"

"What has the actual lapse of time got to do with it?
It is only shallow people who require years to get rid of an emotion.
A man who is master of himself can end a sorrow as easily as he can
invent a pleasure.
I don't want to be at the mercy of my emotions.
I want to use them, to enjoy them, and to dominate them."

"Dorian, this is horrible!
Something has changed you completely.

You were the most unspoiled creature in the whole world.

You talk as if you had no heart, no pity in you.
It is all Harry's influence.
I see that."

.. change::
   - "I want the Dorian Gray I used to know."
   + "I want the Dorian Gray I used to paint," said the artist, sadly.


"Basil," said the lad, going over to him, and putting his hand on his
shoulder, "you have come too late.
Yesterday when I heard that Sibyl Vane had killed herself--"

"Killed herself!
Good heavens! is there no doubt about that?" cried
Hallward, looking up at him with an expression of horror.

"My dear Basil!
Surely you don't think it was a vulgar accident?

   + You know what I mean--middle-class virtue, and all that kind of thing.

How different Sibyl was!
She lived her finest tragedy.
She was always a heroine.
The last night she played--the night you saw her--she acted badly
because she had known the reality of love.
When she knew its unreality, she died, as Juliet might have died.
She passed again into the sphere of art.
There is something of the martyr about her.
Her death has all the pathetic uselessness of martyrdom, all its wasted
beauty.
But, as I was saying, you must not think I have not suffered.

How like a sympathetic person!

who spent twenty years of his life in trying to get some grievance

But the artistic temperament that they create, or at any rate reveal,

   + The painter felt strangely moved.

The lad was infinitely dear to him, and his personality had been the
great turning-point in his art.
He could not bear the idea of reproaching him any more.
After all, his indifference was probably merely a mood that would pass
away.
There was so much in him that was good, so much in him that was noble.

"Well, Dorian," he said, at length, with a sad smile, "I won't speak to
you again about this horrible thing, after to-day.
I only trust your name won't be mentioned in connection with it.
The inquest is to take place this afternoon.

"Only my Christian name, and that I am quite sure she never mentioned

"I will try and do something, Dorian, if it would please you.

I can't get on without you."


.. change::
   - "I will never sit to you again, Basil.

And Hallward walked towards the corner of the room.

A cry of terror broke from Dorian Gray's lips, and he rushed between

"Basil," he said, looking very pale, "you must not look at it.

"Not look at my own work! you are not serious.

Hallward was thunderstruck.
He looked at Dorian Gray in absolute amazement.
He had never seen him like this before.

"Dorian!"

"Don't speak!"

"But what is the matter?
Of course I won't look at it if you don't want me to," he said, rather
coldly, turning on his heel, and going over towards the window.
"But, really, it seems rather absurd that I shouldn't see my own work,
especially as I am going to exhibit it in Paris in the autumn.
I shall probably have to give it another coat of varnish before that,
so I must see it some day, and why not to-day?"

   - "To exhibit it!
   + "To exhibit it?

You want to exhibit it?" exclaimed Dorian Gray, a strange sense of
terror creeping over him.
Was the world going to be shown his secret?
Were people to gape at the mystery of his life?
That was impossible.
Something--he did not know what--had to be done at once.

He stopped suddenly, and a gleam of light came into his eyes.
He remembered that Lord Henry had said to him once, half seriously and

Yes, perhaps Basil, too, had his secret.
He would ask him and try.

"Basil," he said, coming over quite close, and looking him straight in
the face, "we have each of us a secret.

I have always you to look at.
If you wish the best work I have ever done to be hidden from the world,
I am satisfied.
Your friendship is dearer to me than any fame or reputation."


.. change::
   - "No, Basil, you must tell me," murmured Dorian Gray.
   + "No, Basil, you must tell me," insisted Dorian Gray.

"I think I have a right to know."

   + And now good-bye, Dorian.
   + You have been the one person in my life who has really influenced my
   + art.
   + Whatever I have done that is good, I owe to you.
   + Ah! you don't know what it cost me to tell you all that I have told

   - "My dear Basil," cried Dorian, "what have you told me?
   - Simply that you felt that you liked me too much.
   + "My dear Basil," said Dorian, "what have you told me?

That is not even a compliment."

"It was not intended as a compliment.

   - It was a confession."
   + It was a confession.
   + Now that I have made it, something seems to have gone out of me.

"Why, what did you expect, Dorian?
You didn't see anything else in the picture, did you?
There was nothing else to see?"


.. change::
   - "No: there was nothing else to see.
   + "No; there was nothing else to see.

Why do you ask?

.. change::
   - But you mustn't talk about not meeting me again, or anything of that
   - kind.
   + But you mustn't talk about worship.
   + It is foolish.

You and I are friends, Basil, and we must always remain so."

   - "You have got Harry," said Hallward, sadly.
   + "You have got Harry," said the painter, sadly.


"Oh, Harry!" cried the lad, with a ripple of laughter.
"Harry spends his days in saying what is incredible, and his evenings
in doing what is improbable.
Just the sort of life I would like to lead.

   There is something fatal about a portrait.
   It has a life of its own.

I will come and have tea with you.
That will be just as pleasant."

"Pleasanter for you, I am afraid," murmured Hallward, regretfully.

   - "And now good-by.
   + "And now good-bye.

I am sorry you won't let me look at the picture once again.
But that can't be helped.
I quite understand what you feel about it."

As he left the room, Dorian Gray smiled to himself.
Poor Basil! how little he knew of the true reason!
And how strange it was that, instead of having been forced to reveal
his own secret, he had succeeded, almost by chance, in wresting a
secret from his friend!
How much that strange confession explained to him!

.. change::
   - Basil's absurd fits of jealousy, his wild devotion, his extravagant
   - panegyrics, his curious reticences,--he understood them all now, and he
   - felt sorry.
   - There was something tragic in a friendship so colored by romance.

He sighed, and touched the bell.
The portrait must be hidden away at all costs.
He could not run such a risk of discovery again.
